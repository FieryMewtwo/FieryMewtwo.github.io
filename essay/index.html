<p><em>The Landlady</em> by Roald Dahl fits into the horror genre because he uses <strong>dialogue</strong>, <strong>imagery</strong>, and a realistic <strong>setting.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-dialogue">The dialogue:</h2>
<p>In <em>The Landlady</em>, Roald Dahl works magic with dialogue. The dialogue grows with the plot, and hints that the Landlady may be more than meets the eye.</p>
<p>For example, in Paragraph 35, she states:</p>
<p><mark>“Oh, I am, my dear, I am, of course I am. But the trouble is that I’m inclined to be just a teeny weeny bit choosy and particular – if you see what I mean.”</mark></p>
<p>And further down:</p>
<p><mark>“But I’m always ready. Everything is always ready day and night in this house just on the off-chance that an acceptable young gentleman will come along.”</mark></p>
<h2 id="the-imagery">The imagery:</h2>
<p>It takes a true genius to pull off imagery like this. Roald Dahl uses imagery to describe the Landlady through the character Billy. This is amazing. This story really shines with imagery. At first, all Billy sees is a quiet, kind Landlady. But as the story progresses, Billy starts to come to his senses.</p>
<h2 id="the-setting">The setting:</h2>
<p>The setting truly pulls this whole story together. The setting is realistic, being a location in Roald Dahl’s native England. The city is called Bath, and it is a small town with very few residents. This makes it perfect for a story like this.</p>
<p>In the story, it is made clear that Bath is such a tiny town that no one will ever discover what happened to Billy or the other tenants. It’s also sprinkled with some classic Roald Dahl imagery.</p>
