I am pleased to announce that my github.io website now supports FluxBB and other PHP and semi-dynamic web applications via a new domain, fierymewtwo-githubpages-content.42web.io! To the user, the transitions to and from the different websites will be seamless and there will be navigation buttons galore. Enjoy!
